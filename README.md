# Head First: Design Patterns
Head First: Design Patterns, exercises implementation 

**Chapter 1 - Strategy pattern**
lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class and make their objects interchangeable.

**Chapter 2 - Observer pattern**
defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

**Chapter 3 - Decorator pattern**
attach additional responsibilities to an objedt dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

**Chapter 4 - Factory pattern** \
*The Factory Method Pattern* - defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
